              and guidelines for each service or the company establishes that
              the client has abused in any way (including but not limited to

            <h4 class="te2">7. Risk Disclosure</h4>
            <p>
              Clients of Optioning agree to use the site at their own risk.
              Services promoted and provided on this site are suitable only for
              clients who are able to bear the loss of all the money they
              deposit and who are experienced in financial market risk taking.
              The possibility exists that a client could sustain a loss of some
              or all of their initial deposit and therefore client should not
              deposit money that they cannot afford to lose. A client should be
              aware of all the risks associated with options trading and seek
              advice from an independent financial advisor if they have any
              doubts.
            </p>

            <h4 class="te2">8. Financial Information</h4>
            <p>

            <p>

              accuracy, timeliness, completeness or correct sequencing of the

              reliance on the financial information, which is readily accessible
              through other venues. Financial Information may quickly become
              unreliable for various reasons including, for example, changes in
              market conditions or economic circumstances. Neither the company
              nor the Third Party Providers are obligated to update any
              information or opinions contained in any Financial Information.
              This information is not part of the Services provided to a client
              and is only a courtesy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Either provider may discontinue offering Financial Information at
              any time without notice. It is a client’s duty to verify the
              reliability of the information on the site and its suitability to
              their interest. The company disclaims any liability for any
              inaccuracies, loss or damage or any kind allegedly caused by
              information presented on or referenced by the site. Client shall
              not treat the licensee as a financial institution nor expect
              interest on their deposits or account balances.
            </p>
            <h4 class="te2">9. Links</h4>

              solely as a courtesy, and the client agrees that under no
              circumstances will the client hold the company liable for any loss

            <br />
            <ol type="a" class="tcb">
              <li>
                if Optioning has reason to believe that a person’s activities on
                the site may be illegal;
              </li>
              <li>
                if Optioning may be harmed by any fiscal or pecuniary damage due
                to anyone’s activities;
              </li>
              <li>
                if Optioning considers that one or more operations on the site
                were made in violation of this Agreement;
              </li>
              <li>
                if a client uses proxy servers, VPN software or other anonymous
                services to access site and/or platform;
              </li>
              <li>

                to robots, scripts, etc.) to trade through Optioning platform,
                in case a client does not comply with this clause, then he will
                be banned along with his account terminated with no money
                refund;
              </li>
              <li>
                if a client opens more than 5 deals for the same time interval,
                in case a client does not comply with this clause, all open
                deals more than 5 will automatically be canceled and withheld
                from them fine (10-30% from the sum of open deal). Also client's
                profile could be banned for 12 hours for the first time, and
                banned for good with no deposit refund if a client violates
                these rules for the second time.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the deal was made within the first 10 minutes after the break
                for the weekend, the broker has the right to cancel the deal.
                For example on Monday from 12:00 am to 12:10 am it is prohibited
                to place deals.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              On our platform it is forbidden to use the 'binary gambit'
              strategy. A 'binary gambit' strategy in which two deals are opened
              simultaneously, one on 'call', the other on 'put' and then before
              the locking line, depending on the direction of the chart, one of
              the deals is canceled. All deals made under this strategy will not
              be counted.
            </p>
            <h4 class="te2">11. Payment Procedure</h4>
            <p>
              An application for withdrawal of monetary funds should be made out
              by the Client electronically through the internal interface of the
              trading platform. After the Client creates the application, the
              size of the amount withdrawn is not deducted from the balance of
              their account until the moment of the direct payment. Withdrawals
              applied for by the Client are non-refundable and cannot be
              appealed. Minimum withdrawal amount is 0.002 BTC.
            </p>
            <p>
              Optioning finance department supervises every withdrawal request
              submitted. When a withdrawal request is submitted, it may take up
              to 1 business day to process the request. When your application is
              approved, funds are immediately send and transactions available on
              blockchain.info. If the amount in the request for withdrawal
              excess 0.1 BTC per week or 2 BTC per month, the funds may be
              transferred to the Client by instalments, at least every five (5)
              business days.
            </p>
            <p>
              In case the client's account has been suspected of fraudulent
              activities or arbitrage, then client's account will be under close
              scrutiny. If client's account is under investigation, a client
              shall receive only 10% of client's withdrawable capital on a
              monthly basis starting from the date the inquiry is initiated.
              Likewise, no trading benefits assigned to a client will be valid
              in the instance of the inquiry. Once the investigation is
              completed, a client shall receive a refund depending on the
              withdrawable amount remaining. Please note that if ever it has
              been established that any activity on client's trading account is
              of fraudulent nature after the inquiry, then the client's trading
              account will be permanently frozen and a client will be refunded
              with his initial capital. The Client uses the internal interface
              of the Platform to deposit funds into their account. Minimum
              deposit is not provided, the client can enter at his own
              discretion.
            </p>
            <h4 class="te2">12. Dormant Trading</h4>
            <p>
              In case if client's account remains inactive for over 90 days the
              Company may deduct in full all bonus amounts credited to a
              client's account. In the event client's account remains inactive
              for over 30 days, the Company may charge a client for the
              provision of the trading platform and the management of client's
              account, a monthly inactivity fee in an amount of 0.001 BTC. A
              client agrees that he is liable to and will pay the applicable fee
              as notified from time to time and that the Company may deduct such
              fee from any funds held by the Company on client's behalf. For the
