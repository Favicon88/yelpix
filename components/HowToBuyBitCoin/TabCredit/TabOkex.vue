        <li>
          Merchants with the blue tick are designated merchants who have paid a
          certain amount of deposit and hence more credible;
        </li>
        <li>
          Always double-check if the payment has arrived before releasing the
          tokens;
        </li>
        <li>
          Do NOT select "I have paid", if you have not completed the payment;

        <li>
          If the buyer selected "I have paid" but you did not receive any
          payment, select "Dispute" for the help from our customer support;

        <li>
          Do NOT include any wordings about digital assets like Bitcoin, BTC, or
          crypto in the bank transfer note to avoid transaction suspension by
          the bank.
